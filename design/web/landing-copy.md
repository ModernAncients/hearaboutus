## How It Works

### Step 1: Ask at checkout
A tiny prompt invites your customers to vouch for you. Nothing pushy, just a simple question: "Would you put in a good word?"

### Step 2: They share a Marker
If they say yes, they get a small branded trust token—a Marker—they can pass to someone they think would love you. It's personal, not promotional.

### Step 3: You see every warm intro
Your Trust Ledger shows the real flow of referrals. Who's vouching for you, where trust is moving, and how those small gestures add up to something meaningful.

## Product Preview

**What you'll see**

Your Trust Ledger is a calm, clear view of how trust moves through your network. You'll see your Warm Intro Strength (WIS) score, track every Marker shared, and watch as advocates emerge naturally. There's no gamification, no leaderboards—just honest visibility into the relationships that matter.

The Marker itself is simple: a small card your customers can share via text, email, or link. It carries your name and a message they can personalize. When someone clicks it, you see the connection. When they become a customer, you see the full trail.

## Why It Matters

Most of your growth comes from a small group of people who put in a good word. You know this intuitively—the friend who recommends your coffee shop, the colleague who shares your consulting service, the neighbor who tells someone about your local business.

But until now, those gestures were invisible. You couldn't see them, thank them, or understand how they compound over time.

Hear About Us makes those gestures visible, measurable, and meaningful—without turning trust into a cheap funnel metric. We're not building another referral program. We're building infrastructure for reciprocity.

This is for founders who live on referrals, who know their best customers come from genuine recommendations, and who want to honor that trust instead of exploiting it.

**Local businesses**
Your community is your network. Track how trust moves through your neighborhood, and make it easy for happy customers to share you with friends.

**Small teams**
You're past the "just get customers" phase and into building real relationships. Understand which advocates drive the most meaningful connections.

**Agencies & consultants**
You manage multiple clients and need to see trust activity across businesses. The Observatory view gives you clarity without complexity.
